# Java Precheck-task

Develop a java program to insert a list of participants where the fields where name and surname,
age, type of sport, list of awards.

This implementation was done through 3 total classes.
* Main
* Participants
* StateMachine

*Main* class, file where the implementation is run. Here the definition of the participants information was set and the objects of the other classes (Participants.java & StateMachine.java) where created.

*Participants* class has the layout to fill the information needed, for example the setters to fill the information requested by the user; and the getters this to obtain the information of the array class 'Participants' so this can be printed in the terminal.

*StateMachine* class is a simple file to make use of a Moore State Machine to make this program more automated. This while using a switch case to make the state machine go through, in this example the only use of the state machine class is to limit the possible jumps that can be done in the switch case (most simple state machine)

Notes to improve:
Make the program so the user can add and modify the information freely.
Make the state machin possible jumps more restricting.



The desition to use a state machin was primarly to continue learning java, as the implementation of a state machine can be re-used for other coding exercises for a more clean and controlled system.
